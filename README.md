**I created this project to be responsive but the mobile screen optimalization is missing**

# Hello

# My name is Norbert Kovacs

This Project uses an Api call, for data from different currency , and you can select your phone , and take that data to the Calculation page where you can calculate the price , depending on the phones.json data.
For this i use Context API.

Glad you come by, and read my introduction to this project, have a nice day !
